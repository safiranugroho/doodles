    'Grace Hopper was a pioneering computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and invented the first compiler, an important tool that translates written code into machine language that a computer can understand.',
    'Hopper popularized the term "debugging" to describe the process of removing errors from a computer program. Her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.',
    `She also helped develop COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. Hopper's contributions to computer science and technology were significant and she is often referred to as the "mother of computing."`,
    'Hopper was known to carry around a piece of wire that was exactly one foot long, which she called her "standard." She would use this wire to help explain the concept of a "nanosecond" (one billionth of a second) to her colleagues. It was a way to physically show them how small a nanosecond is and help them understand the speed at which computers worked.'
